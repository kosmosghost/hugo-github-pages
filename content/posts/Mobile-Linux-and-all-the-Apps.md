What can you do on Mobile Linux?

It started out really rough. Daily driving a mobile device running mainline Linux with an open-source phone environment was nearly impossible. That is slowly changing and in the last few years things have been progressing to an "almost" pleasant experience. We've gotten more apps, and less bugs. With the more time that has passed I am reaching less for my iPhone, and more for my oneplus6 device running postmarketOS.

## Let's start with the home screen.

To be honest, I actually prefer the plasma mobile UX, but phosh is currently more usable, has working audio and video, and also looks pretty neat.

## Weather:

The weather app looks like a professional mobile app and compares well with the weather app on IOS.

## Web Browsing:

This is the desktop version of Firefox with a mobile configuration.  Audio and video work just fine. It's plenty performant on my oneplus6 device.

## Plasmatube:

In addition to using the web browser, I am also using Plasma Tube to view youtube videos. With it, I can subscribe without having to log in to a youtube account. Freetube also works great.

## Audiobooks:

For audiobooks, I am using the app 'Cozy.' It works well enough, and I have zero issues. Plasma Mobile comes with an app called 'Kasts.' My only issue is that while I can download and listen to podcasts from the app, I cannot stream them. I understand this issue has been resolved in the next release.

Replacing Apple News with RSS Feeds:
In the past, I have had an issue with Apple News. I am now using the app 'Newsflash.' Newsflash has all the features I have ever wanted in an RSS app.

Nextcloud:

Games:
What I miss most coming from a mainstream mobile device such as Android or IOS are the games. Fortunately, there are a few on the Mobile Linux ecosystem that are quite playable. Aisleriot is a collection of card games, such as FreeCell and solitaire. There is also gnome-2048 and gnome-chess. One of the sweetest things I have found when using mobile Linux is that I can also add the NYT Mini crossword puzzle to my home screen, as well as Wordle.

EBooks:
Foliate works pretty great as an EBook reader, but there are some bugs when using it with Plasma. As a workaround, I open the app from the terminal and it works pretty well.

Mastodon:
While there are many apps to choose from for a Mastodon client, I have settled on adding the web app to my home screen. It has the most features, with the least amount of bugs.
