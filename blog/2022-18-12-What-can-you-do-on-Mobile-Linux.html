    <h1 class="title">What can you do on Mobile Linux?</h1>
              </header>
      <p>Over the last few years, running Linux on mobile devices has only gotten better. About a month ago, I decided to try to challenge myself to daily drive the pinephone for seven days. The experience was painful. The pinephone hardware was just too slow. Since then, I have switched to the oneplus6t, running postmarketOS with Plasma Mobile. It has become my primary device.</p>
      <h2 id="weather">Weather:</h2>
      <p>The weather app looks like a professional mobile app and compares well with the weather app on IOS.</p>
      <div class="center">
      <img src="../Pictures/weather.png" title="Weather App" alt="weather" /> <img src="../Pictures/weather.png" title="Weather App" alt="weather" />
      </div>
      <h2 id="web-browsing">Web Browsing:</h2>
      <p>I mostly use the web browser Angelfish, which comes included with Plasma Mobile. Angelfish plays Youtube videos at 720p without any issues. Audio does also work.</p>
      <h2 id="youtube">Youtube:</h2>
      <p>In addition to using the web browser, I am also using Freetube to view youtube videos. With it, I can subscribe without having to log in to a youtube account. It uses electron as the backend.</p>
      <h2 id="audiobooks-and-podcasts">Audiobooks and Podcasts:</h2>
      <p>For audiobooks, I am using the app ‘Cozy.’ It works well enough, and I have zero issues. Plasma Mobile comes with an app called ‘Kasts.’ My only issue is that while I can download and listen to podcasts from the app, I cannot stream them. I understand this issue has been resolved in the next release.</p>

      <img src="../Pictures/cozy.png" title="Cozy" alt="Kasts" /> <img src="../Pictures/cozy-2.png" alt="Cozy" /> <img src="../Pictures/kasts.png" />
      </div>
      <h2 id="replacing-apple-news-with-rss-feeds">Replacing Apple News with RSS Feeds:</h2>
      <p>In the past, I have had an issue with Apple News. I am now using the app ‘Newsflash.’ Newsflash has all the features I have ever wanted in an RSS app.</p>
      <h2 id="games">Games:</h2>
      <p>What I miss most coming from a mainstream mobile device such as Android or IOS are the games. Fortunately, there are a few on the Mobile Linux ecosystem that are quite playable. Aisleriot is a collection of card games, such as FreeCell and solitaire. There is also gnome-2048 and gnome-chess. One of the sweetest things I have found when using mobile Linux is that I can also add the NYT Mini crossword puzzle to my home screen, as well as Wordle.</p>
      <h2 id="ebooks">EBooks:</h2>
      <p>Foliate works pretty great as an EBook reader, but there are some bugs when using it with Plasma. As a workaround, I open the app from the terminal and it works pretty well.</p>
      <h2 id="mastodon">Mastodon:</h2>
      <p>While there are many apps to choose from for a Mastodon client, I have settled on adding the web app to my home screen. It has the most features, with the least amount of bugs.</p>
      <h2 id="battery-life">Battery Life:</h2>
      <p>The battery life is surprisingly good. As soon as I got the oneplus6t I immediately put Linux on it, so I can’t compare it to Android. At a full 100% charge, I did mild web browsing, RSS reads, and played some games. I only lost 6% battery after 44 minutes.</p>
      <h2 id="issues">Issues:</h2>
      <p>Plasma Shell crashes frequently. When I push the power button to unlock the device, the screen will flash on and then turn off. I have found that by pushing the volume down button, the screen won’t turn off and I can finally unlock the screen. Auto rotate doesn’t work. I don’t know if it is because of my device, or if it doesn’t work yet. Wifi on the 5ghz band is broken. I can use wifi on the 2.4ghz band, however.</p>
