title: What apps am I using on my Linux Mobile Phone
---

# Lets start with web browsing

<div class=center>![browsing](../Pictures/screenshot-firefox.png "Firefox") </div>

I am using Firefox for my main web browsing experience. I do have Angelfish, which comes with Plasma-Mobile as well. Angelfish let's me add webpages to my homescreen. For example, by using the "Add to homescreen" function on the Angelfish GUI, I have added several web apps, including Mastodon, and some games from NYT.

# EBook Reader

<div class=center>![ereader](../Pictures/foliate.png "Foliate") </div>

There is an app called Foliate that is available on both the postmarketOS repositories, and also flathub. It's an E-Reader app, and it works great! It comes with support for repositories of books in the free domain, like [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ "Project Gutenberg").

# Media

<div class=center>![vlc](../Pictures/vlc.png "VLC") </div>

For video I am using VLC. This can be installed from the postmarketOS repositories using `sudo apk add vlc-qt`. VLC scales really well in phosh, but it doesn't scale very well with plasma-mobile.


<div class=center>![kasts](../Pictures/kasts.png "Kasts") </div>

Kasts is an app from the Plasma-Mobile ecosystem that runs just as good using Phosh.  For a while, we would need to download an entire episode before listening, but recently they added a new feature that allows us to stream the podcast. It's a great app, but I don't use it very often. I still use my iPhone for podcasts because of Apple Carplay.


<div class=center>![elisa](../Pictures/elisa.png "Elisa") </div>

I don't listen to music, but the Plasma team has another really good app called Elisa. I have played around with it, and have it installed. If I did listen to music, this is the app I would choose.


<div class=center>![cozy](../Pictures/cozy.png "Cozy") </div>


As far as audiobooks are concerned, I use cozy. It isn't available in the postmarketOS repos, but you can install it with flatpak, as it is available on flathub.

# RSS

<div class=center>![rss](../Pictures/newsflash.png "Newsflash") </div>

For my rss reader I am using Newsflash. It works great on the desktop, but does have a few bugs here and there on the mobile phone. Overall, I am happy with it.

# Weather

<div class=center>![weather](../Pictures/weather.png "kweather") </div>

For my weather app, I am using kweather from the Plasma team. I have a fondness for this app, because it looks so good.

# Social Media (Mastodon)

<div class=center>![mastodon](../Pictures/mastodon.png "Mastodon") </div>


I am not a big social media guy. I log in once a day just to see if I can find anything new in the Linux or Mobile Linux world. There are a number of Mastodon apps, like Tokodon, and Tooth, and they are really great. I found that I was happiest using Angelfish to just install the Mastodon web app to my homescreen.

# Games

And that brings me to why I have Angelfish installed on my phone, even though I prefer firefox as a browser. Take a look at wordle and the NYT daily mini crossword as web apps available straight from my homescreen.

<div class=center>![wordle](../Pictures/wordle.png "Kasts") </div>

<div class=center>![crossword](../Pictures/nytcross.png "Kasts") </div>

There are other games I have installed on my phone, including aisleriot (better if installed from flathub), gnome-chess, gnome-2048, and gnome-soduku.

# Password Manager

<div class=center>![pwd](../Pictures/pwd.png "gnome-passwordsafe") </div>


Finally, we are nearing the end of the list. For my password manager, I am using gnome-passwordsafe. It reads kbdx files, such as the ones used my keepass. It's bug free, but I do miss the feature on iPhone's where password managers can be opened with my face.

# That's all folks

That's all for now.
