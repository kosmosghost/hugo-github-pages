title: What can you do on Mobile Linux?
---

Over the last few years, running Linux on mobile devices has only gotten better. About a month ago, I decided to try to challenge myself to daily drive the pinephone for seven days. The experience was painful. The pinephone hardware was just too slow. Since then, I have switched to the oneplus6t, running postmarketOS with Plasma Mobile. It has become my primary device.

## Weather:
The weather app looks like a professional mobile app and compares well with the weather app on IOS.

## Web Browsing:
I mostly use the web browser Angelfish, which comes included with Plasma Mobile. Angelfish plays Youtube videos at 720p without any issues. Audio does also work.

## Youtube:
In addition to using the web browser, I am also using Freetube to view youtube videos. With it, I can subscribe without having to log in to a youtube account. It uses electron as the backend.

## Audiobooks and Podcasts:
For audiobooks, I am using the app 'Cozy.' It works well enough, and I have zero issues. Plasma Mobile comes with an app called 'Kasts.' My only issue is that while I can download and listen to podcasts from the app, I cannot stream them. I understand this issue has been resolved in the next release.

## Replacing Apple News with RSS Feeds:
In the past, I have had an issue with Apple News. I am now using the app 'Newsflash.' Newsflash has all the features I have ever wanted in an RSS app. 

## Games:
What I miss most coming from a mainstream mobile device such as Android or IOS are the games. Fortunately, there are a few on the Mobile Linux ecosystem that are quite playable. Aisleriot is a collection of card games, such as FreeCell and solitaire. There is also gnome-2048 and gnome-chess. One of the sweetest things I have found when using mobile Linux is that I can also add the NYT Mini crossword puzzle to my home screen, as well as Wordle.

## EBooks:
Foliate works pretty great as an EBook reader, but there are some bugs when using it with Plasma. As a workaround, I open the app from the terminal and it works pretty well.

## Mastodon:
While there are many apps to choose from for a Mastodon client, I have settled on adding the web app to my home screen. It has the most features, with the least amount of bugs.

## Battery Life:
The battery life is surprisingly good. As soon as I got the oneplus6t I immediately put Linux on it, so I can't compare it to Android. At a full 100% charge, I did mild web browsing, RSS reads, and played some games. I only lost 6% battery after 44 minutes.

## Issues:
Plasma Shell crashes frequently.
When I push the power button to unlock the device, the screen will flash on and then turn off. I have found that by pushing the volume down button, the screen won't turn off and I can finally unlock the screen.
Auto rotate doesn't work. I don't know if it is because of my device, or if it doesn't work yet.
Wifi on the 5ghz band is broken. I can use wifi on the 2.4ghz band, however.
